# ScratcHTML

ScratcHTML (pronounced scratch-t-m-l) is going to be a simple website for making HTML using scratchblocks.  
It's currently (very, ***very***, much) a work in progress, so there may be bugs scattered around the place.

## How does it work?

Currently all of ScratcHTML is just a concept, but here's how it's going to work:  
Drag and drop blocks from the palette to build up an HTML document, just like regular Scratch.

## Why?

why not? <sup>(aka i was bored and came up with this)</sup>
